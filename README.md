# PGHE-Net

**Abstract:** Haze in the atmosphere diminishes the visibility of optical remote sensing images (RSIs), making optical RSI dehazing an essential pre-processing step for geographic monitoring and advanced computer vision tasks. While current CNN-based dehazing technologies have shown impressive results with natural images, they often struggle with detail blurring and color distortion when applied to RSIs. In this paper, we propose a physically guided dehazing network with high-frequency enhancement (PGHE-Net), which includes a channel attention-based high-frequency enhancement (CAHE) and a physical guided-based refiner (PGR). The CAHE is crafted to compensate for the loss of high-frequency information of features, which utilizes multiscale feature fusion and gated attention mechanisms to mine haze features of different distributions and concentrations. To further enhance the restoration of features in hazy regions, the PGR is developed to guide spatial attention to interact with channel attention utilizing a physical model to refine hierarchically and progressively reconstructed images at different scales. Experiments on three public benchmark RSIs demonstrate the superiority of the proposed method in RSI dehazing.
